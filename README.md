Using the OASIS dataset of MRI data, we built and evaluated various ML algorithms to detect Alzheimer's from the first visit itself. We began by conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), which unveiled crucial insights into the relationship between various clinical features and dementia. This initial phase laid the groundwork for our subsequent data preprocessing steps, where we addressed missing values and standardized our dataset for robust analysis. A pivotal aspect of our research was the integration of cognitive metrics, specifically MMSE scores and educational levels, alongside traditional MRI features. This unique approach allowed us to develop a model that not only leverages structural imaging data but also incorporates cognitive assessments, enhancing the accuracy and depth of our diagnostic capabilities. Our findings indicate that this holistic model outperformed traditional methods, showcasing the potential of incorporating cognitive metrics in dementia diagnosis.
